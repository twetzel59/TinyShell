# TinyShell
### A simple educational command line to teach students how to invoke the C++ compiler and basic utilities

## Background
This is a small "fake shell" that will be incorporated into a larger teaching project. It pretends to be a native command line on a UNIX-like system. Keep in mind that almost no actual ``bash`` fuctionality will be implemented. The goal is to teach students to invoke a compiler and perhaps navigate the filesystem. That's about it.

## How to use
To run it, close the repository and install Python 3.7. At the repo root, run:
```
python3 shell.py
```

## Legal
Do whatever you want. This is in the public domain. If it's useful to you, then use it :D
